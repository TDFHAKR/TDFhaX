Tudify Phone jailbreak tool for mac(not needed on tudifyOS 20)
![a screenshot of the app](https://tudify.co.uk/TudifyXhack.png)

## Limitations
### security features
**you cannot disable security features on tudifyOS. It is impossible, simple as that.**

## installing Other OSes
### Some DepthUI for tudify builds will not function.
DepthUI for tudify Version F4, revisions 1 and 2 are unavailable for download as tudify bricked them in their dispute with pear.

## Adding scarlett to tudifyOS
this will not work yet as scarlett (the secret unnanounced Tudify AI found in DepthUI for tudify) has not been implemeted yet in tudifyOS and might not ever be.

warning

make sure you have the `TDF_C` variable set to `False` if you would like to use this app on a tudifyOS 17, you can do this by using Tudify_P_CMD_Line and typing
`Variables.Sys"TDF_C" = "False"`
